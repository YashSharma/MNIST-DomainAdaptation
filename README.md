# MNIST-DomainAdaptation

In this project, we implement the mutual information maximization loss proposed in MaNi: Maximizing Mutual Information for Nuclei Cross-Domain Unsupervised Segmentation for MNIST data domain adaptation task. The domain shift issue is a common problem in Deep Learning when the source and target images come from different distributions. Multiple ongoing works are trying to address this problem using different approaches: feature-level alignment, input-level alignment, clustering assumption, auxiliary unsupervised learning, and alternative training. This problem is defined as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) when we have access to labeled source images and unlabeled target images. In this work, we used our recently published Mutual Information maximization loss to tackle the domain-shift issue for UDA. For setting up the environment for domain shift, we used MNIST data as the source domain and MNIST-M data as the target domain. MNIST-M data is created by combining MNIST digits with randomly extracted patches of color photos of BSDS500 as their background. This shift from grayscale images to color images with different backgrounds leads to a domain shift in original images and results in a drop in the performance of the model trained on the MNIST dataset. To counter this domain shift drop, we experimented with two approaches, Gradient Reversal and Mutual Information maximization.
